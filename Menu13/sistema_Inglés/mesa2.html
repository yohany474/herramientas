                            <h3>Historia</h3>
                            <p>
                                Once upon a time, there was a young girl named
                                Emily who had a big dream of becoming a famous
                                singer. She knew that achieving her dream would
                                require a lot of hard work and dedication, but
                                she was determined to make it happen.
                                One day, Emily decided to take action and make a
                                plan for achieving her goal. She sat down and
                                wrote out a list of all the things she needed to
                                do, from practicing her singing every day to
                                networking with industry professionals.
                                As she looked at her list, she realized that
                                some of the items would require her to make some
                                major changes in her life. She would need to
                                start taking voice lessons, save up money to
                                record a demo, and even move to a bigger city
                                where there were more opportunities for aspiring
                                singers.
                                But Emily was confident that she could do it,
                                and she knew that with hard work and
                                determination, she would achieve her dream. She
                                decided to use both "will" and "going to" to
                                talk about her future plans.
                                She said to herself, "I will work hard every day
                                to improve my singing skills, and I am going to
                                save up enough money to record a demo. I will
                                also start looking for a vocal coach, and I am
                                going to move to a bigger city where I can meet
                                more people in the music industry."
                                And so, Emily set out on her journey to become a
                                famous singer. She worked hard every day,
                                practiced her singing, and followed her plan.
                                And in the end, her hard work paid off. She
                                landed a recording contract and became a
                                successful singer, all because she believed in
                                herself and was willing to do whatever it took
                                to achieve her dreams.
